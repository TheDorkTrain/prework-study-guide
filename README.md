# Bootcamp Prework Study Guide Webpage

## There are a few like it, but this one is mine. A nice practice project for class.

- This project guided me through the basics of HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript
- It was a big confidence boost in alot of ways, and let me overcome some struggles and easy learing at my own pace.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

There are some handy notes for things to remember about the basics of each program. Probably best to go over all of them since there are not many but if you want a random start you can check the console.

## Credits

The unknown to me writers of the bootcamp training course. I just followed the directions.
